# Radius-Rooster-App
Java Android application for students of Radius College, so they are able to view their school schedule

Home made (and kind of dead) project i made myself, because i was tired of going through the login process over and over again...

*** This project is NOT active right now. If needed, I'll push some (security) patches and bug fixes. 
I know that the code looks HORRIBLE, but I made this app in the first year of my education. (+ I learned this language myself)
I would (ofcourse) be able to change it to decent looking code, but meh, f**k it, it works and it is an educational project only***
